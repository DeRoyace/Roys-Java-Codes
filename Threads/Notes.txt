          THREADS & PROCESSES
---------------------------------------
Key terms:
 - Process : It is the execution of a program / currently active program. It is made up of several threads.
 - Thread : It is a single sequence of execution within a program. It is a subprocess.

We are all familiar with multi-tasking as it does in all modern OS. Multi-tasking means doing multiple tasks at the same time. 
  There exists two distinct types of Multi-tasking:
	- Process Based
	- Thread Based

Process based multi-tasking (or multiprocessing): this makes your device to run multiple programs concurrently. Here, a program is the smallest unit of dispatchable code. Example, you are watching a tutorial video in your browser, and at the same time your are taking notes in a text editor of the same device. The process can have the following states new, ready, running, waiting, blocked & terminated. A process can create other processes which are known as Child Processes. Changes to the parent process do not affect child processes. 

Thread based multi-tasking (or multithreading): this makes a single program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Here, thread is the smallest unit of dispatchable code. Example, in a word processor we are typing something which is one thread and at the same time the contents are getting autosaved (another thread). A thread has 5 states: New, Active[Running, Ready], Blocked & Dead.

Life cycle of thread in brief: 
	- When a thread is created it remains in new state untill we start() the thread to make it in Active state. 
	- Now the thread can either be running or ready to run as soon as it gets CPU time. 
	- A running thread can be suspended using suspend() or wait(), which temporarily halts its activity. 
	- A suspended thread can then be resumed (using resume() or notify() ), and continue the progress where it left. 
	- A thread can be blocked if all the resources not available beforehand.
	- A thread can be terminated any time, from any state using stop(), and it cannot be resumed then.

We also have sleep(n) to make the thread in block state for n milliseconds.
yield() - it is used to explicity switch the control from running to ready state.

Threads share same memory space/ address of the process while process has their own address space. Since all threads of the same process share address space and other resources so any changes to the main thread may affect the behavior of the other threads of the process, wrt to address space only.

Thus, we can conclude that process deals with a 'big picture' and thread handles the details.

 # Points of Differences:
	1. Thread requires less overhead then processes.
	2. Threads are lightweight while processes are heavyweight as they need their own address space.
	3. Thread takes less time to terminate as compared to the process.
	4. Interthread communication is inexpensive, while interprocess communication is expensive.
				OR
	   Context switching from one thread to another is lower in cost as compared to process.
	5. Thread takes less time in context switching while Process takes more time.
	6. Threads share same memory while processes are isolated.
	7. Thread based multi-tasking is under Java's direct control while process based multi-tasking is not.

Q. How to create  multi-threads in Java?
Ans: Thread can be created via two different ways:
    - by extending the Thread class
    - by implementing the Runnable interface

Thread class is present in lang package i.e., java.lang.Thread;
By default we have the main() as our main thread.

Benifits of multithreaded system:

	In single threaded systems the execution of subparts of a program is done one by one. This makes the other thread to run only when the currently working thread gets finished. So until the current thread gets over, the next thread in queue cant be executed. This reduces the efficiency of the cpu as the cpu cycles through for every single thread to be executed. Result the program takes time to get executed completely.

	To avoid this scenario, we have now the mutithreaded systems in our computers. As we can see our CPUs comes with multi-core. So that each core will handle different processes of a single program parallely (at the same time) to make it run faster. This reduecs the inefficiency by preventing the waste of CPU cycles.

	Although we can see that single core systems can also run more than one programs, yet comparatively slower than muti-core. In a core the scenario is such that the program get switch very fast that makes us feel that the programs are running parallely, but actually not. The context switching speed depends upon the processors. For instance, a single core i5 will do faster context switching than a single core i3 systems.

	Suppose we have three threads t1, t2, t3 of a program. So in multithreaded systems this thread will run at the same time provided if each threads are independent of each other. If resources not availabe to make one of the thread to run then the other threads will keep running.
	But in single threaded system we will find that each thread is running at one at a time, and if resources is not available to run the thread then the program stops completely.
